Hello,
I am a senior web & mobile developer with over 8 years of experience and I have worked with my account on the Upwork platform and got over 2500$ a month but my account was suspended several months ago due to irregular activities.
My one client wanted to work with me off the platform, so I agreed.
That’s why my account was disabled.
So I would like to use your Upwork.com account.
In fact, I can create another Asian upwork account.
But as you know, European and American clients prefer to work with European or American developers, because they have professional skills and provide high quality work.
So, working with your Upwork account makes it easier for me to get jobs on Upwork and makes a lot more money than using an Asian account.
That’s why I would like to use your Upwork account.
If you don't work on Upwork right now, I believe you can help me.
If you can help me, I can earn over 8000$  every month and  I will share a percentage fee of the total income from Upwork or fixed profit.
We can discuss the fee.
If you can help my call with the clients ,  I will pay you additional profit.
I'm serious without trying to cheat you at all.
I think the most important thing in our collaboration is to trust each other.
Without this, we cannot work together.
If you agree with my suggestion, feel free to contact me. Welcome at any time.
If my suggestion bothers you, accept my apology.
Thank you for reviewing my suggestion.
