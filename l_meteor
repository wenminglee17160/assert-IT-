Okay.
if you make a decision, let me know .
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 10:56 AM
Yes.
Hi
Are you there?
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 11:02 AM
here.
what's the matter?
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 11:03 AM
How much can you pay per month?
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 11:05 AM
I can pay 10% of my income per month.
Normally I can earn 4k-5k per month.
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 11:06 AM
Great
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 11:07 AM
Okay,
I think we can start by creating the account.
For this collaboration, we need to setup remote connection to the laptop in your area so that I can use your account in the laptop by remotely
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 11:08 AM
What?
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 11:08 AM
So if you have extra laptop that you are not using right, it'd better.
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 11:08 AM
I mean the remote connection.
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 11:09 AM
I have only a laptop.
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 11:09 AM
Then we can install VM(Virtual machine) in your laptop and then I can use your acc in the VM.
It is because if I login to your account in my location, it can be suspdended because of IP changes.
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 11:11 AM
I understand now
Btw, where are you from?
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 11:12 AM
I am from Singapore
How do you think about the VM solution.
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 11:14 AM
I think it's a good idea.
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 11:14 AM
Okay, Good
Then when will you have time to install the VM?
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 11:14 AM
But I have a question.
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 11:14 AM
Please tell me./
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 11:16 AM
Why don't you create your own account?
I think you are a scammer.
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 11:17 AM
I have used my account a few years ago
But it is blocked because of IP change, after that i realized it is against to their policy
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 11:18 AM
If you think so, I think we can't move forward for our collaboration.
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 11:22 AM
I see.
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 12:38 PM
?
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 12:40 PM
Hi
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 12:41 PM
What is your thoughts?
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 12:42 PM
I think we can make a good collaboration for each other by trust for each other.
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 12:42 PM
I think so but ...
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 12:42 PM
What is your concern actually?
I understand we can't trust very well strangers.
But we meet new friends like this way. ðŸ™‚
I'd like to know your concern and I will explain as much as I can.
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 12:44 PM
This is my first time doing this.
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 12:44 PM
I understand, It is first time for me too.
Actually I have several friends who is working as a freelancer and I have recently notice that they are collaborating with others like this way.
So I decided to find a reliable collaborator who can work with me.
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 12:47 PM
But can you really earn 6k a month?
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 12:49 PM
Yeah, actually it will need hard work, but I think I can do it.
Honestly, I can't earn from the first month, but I think I can increase it for a few months.
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 12:51 PM
So how do you pay for the first month?
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 12:52 PM
If I didn't earn any money for the first month, I can pay 50$ per month flatly.
If I earn more than 500 $ per month, I will  pay 10% of my income.
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 12:55 PM
What should I do?
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 12:57 PM
We can start by installing VM in your laptop and then after create Upwork account, you just need to keep it on.
And when they ask ID verification, you can verify it using your phone./
This is all you need to do.
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 12:58 PM
From what time to what time should I turn on my PC?
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 12:59 PM
Actually, I should be able to connect there anytime.
So it is needed to keep it on 24/7.
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 1:00 PM
That's no problem.
I want my income to be fixed.
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 1:01 PM
I understand it.
But I think my suggestion is not bad for you.
You can get paid flatly even if I didn't earn money. 
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 1:03 PM
Then, can you pay $100 if you earn less than $500?
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 1:04 PM
Hmmm...
Then how about do it with middle price?
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 1:05 PM
You mean $75?
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 1:06 PM
Otherwise I suggest flat $100 per month including when I earn more than $1000.
Also I need to consume my money to buy connects in Upwork to send proposals.
We consume connects in Upwork to send proposals. It is not small money, normally I pay 3-5$ per proposals.
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 1:08 PM
okay, $100 a month?
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 1:09 PM
Yes, but it means I pay 100$ per month if I ean more than 1000$ per month, not 10%.
Is it okay for you?
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 1:10 PM
yes
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 1:10 PM
Okay, Then let's get started by installing VM in your laptop.
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 1:11 PM
Yes, I will install it.
Can you pay before start?
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 1:11 PM
How about this?
After ID verification, I will pay half of the first month.
Then I will pay rest 50 at the end of this first month.
So the day we passed ID verification will be pay day for each month.
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 1:13 PM
I think it's not fair for me.
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 1:13 PM
Why do you think so?
Actually we can ensure the account is safe after we pass the ID verification.
Then I can use the account actively.
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 1:15 PM
I don't know who you are and I have to share my PC
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 1:17 PM
Actually this collaboration should be proceed under the condition of trust for each other.
We will be passed the ID verification in a few days.
If you want we can do video meeting and see each other before we get started.
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 1:18 PM
okay
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 1:19 PM
Let me know your available time for it.
J.B â€” 1/23/2025 1:21 PM
If you can't pay before start, I can't work with you.
l_meteor â€” 1/23/2025 1:21 PM
Okay, then we can't move forward.
