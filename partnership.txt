Hi,

I hope this message finds you well! My name is Wen Ming Lee, and I’m a passionate frontend developer with over six years of experience in React, Vue, and Angular. Throughout my journey on Upwork, particularly with a Germany-based account, I’ve been fortunate to build a wonderful reputation with my clients.
Unfortunately, due to personal circumstances, my account holder can no longer support me, and I'm now seeking a new collaboration partner. When I came across your GitHub profile, I felt a strong connection to your work and would love the opportunity to discuss a potential partnership.

Here’s a Simple Proposal.

Option 1: Utilize Your Existing Upwork Account
If you have an Upwork account that you’re not actively using, I would be thrilled to collaborate through it. To maintain security and avoid any issues, I would access it directly from your computer using trusted remote tools like TeamViewer or AnyDesk. This way, we can ensure everything stays secure and compliant with Upwork’s policies.

Option 2: Create a New Account Together
If you’re open to it, we could consider setting up a new Upwork account specifically for our collaboration. This could be a great way to start fresh and build something together!

Financial Transactions
For transferring funds, we can easily set up Payoneer or PayPal on your Upwork account. Once I earn through your account, you would receive 10% of the earnings, and the remainder can be sent to my PayPal or Payoneer.

Why TeamViewer or AnyDesk?
Upwork has strict rules regarding account usage from different locations. By accessing your account directly from your local machine, we can avoid potential blocks that may arise from using VPNs or other methods. If privacy is a concern, we can even set up a virtual machine to keep everything separate and secure.

Trust and Security
I want to assure you that your account’s security is my top priority. Upwork’s systems are designed to detect unauthorized access, so any attempt to log in from a different location would immediately trigger a block. Also, your presence is vital during client interactions, as Upwork often requires video chats.

Additional Opportunities
If you have any personal projects that could benefit from development work, I’d be more than happy to lend a hand. My goal is to deliver high-quality results that align with your vision.
Thank you for considering this partnership! I genuinely believe we could create something remarkable together. I look forward to hearing from you soon and exploring how we can collaborate effectively.

Warm regards,
Wen Ming Lee

Hi,

I hope this message finds you pleasant!  I am a dedicated front-end developer with 6+ years of experience in React, Vue and Angular. For many years, I have proudly worked on Upwork through my account in Germany and have built a solid reputation with my clients. Unfortunately, due to personal circumstances, the account owner is no longer able to support me and I am looking for a new collaborator. Your GitHub profile really caught my attention and I felt an immediate connection to your work.

A partnership based on trust
I believe that collaboration is based on trust, communication and mutual support. In my previous partnership, I shared 10% of my monthly income with the account owner and I would like to build a similar long-term relationship with you. Together, we can showcase our skills and create amazing projects that drive success.

How we can work together
Option 1: Use an existing Upwork account
If you have an Upwork account that you are not actively using, I would be happy to collaborate with you through that account while you are gone. To ensure everything is safe and compliant, we use a reliable remote tool like TeamViewer or AnyDesk to access your computer directly. This approach avoids IP conflicts and keeps your account safe.

Option 2: Create a new account together
If you are interested, you can consider setting up a new Upwork account specifically for our collaboration. This new beginning can be a fantastic opportunity for both of us.

Seamless financial transactions
For fund transfers, you can easily integrate Payoneer or PayPal with your Upwork account. When you earn money through your account, I pay you 10% of the revenue and send the rest to my PayPal or Payoneer. This simple process ensures transparency and fairness in our partnership.

Why should I choose TeamViewer or AnyDesk?
Upwork has a strict policy on account usage from different locations. Accessing your account directly from your local machine is very important to avoid potential bans. If you are concerned about privacy, you can set up a virtual machine (VM) on your computer to keep everything separate and secure.

Peace of Mind
I know that entrusting your Upwork account to someone else can be a concern. I am committed to maintaining the highest level of integrity. Upwork’s security measures prevent unauthorized access by immediately blocking you from logging in from any other location. Additionally, Upwork often requires video chat, so your presence during client interactions is essential.

Additional Opportunities
If you have a personal project that could benefit from development work, I would be happy to lend my expertise. My goal is to provide high-quality results that are perfectly aligned with your vision.

I truly believe that together we can create amazing things. If you are interested in discussing this further, I would love to see how we can make this partnership beneficial to both of us. Thank you for considering this opportunity, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Warmest regards,
Wen Ming Lee

For many years I have had the privilege of working on Upwork through an account in Germany where I have built a solid reputation with clients.

This has led me to look for a new collaborator and your impressive GitHub profile really caught my eye.

Collaboration Request

In my previous contract, I shared 10% of my monthly income with the account holder and I would like to have a similar long-term partnership with you. I truly believe that together we can create great projects that showcase our combined talents.

How we can work together

The importance of direct access

We understand that the idea of sharing account access can be concerning. Upwork has strict rules about using it from other locations, and it is important that you access your account directly from your local computer to avoid potential bans. If you are concerned about privacy, you can also set up a virtual machine (VM) on your computer to keep everything separate and secure.

Trust is paramount
