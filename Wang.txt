I hope you understand all the issues correctly.
If your IP address changes during account creation or use, these issues can negatively affect your account.
One account can be used per IP address, and we need to use the account on one IP.
If the IP address that created the account is detected as different, the account will also be killed.
Also, if you have already created and used a freelance account on your computer, you can use it for a certain period of time after account creation, but the account will be blocked.
Do not sign up for all freelancing accounts with different computers or mobile phones.
Duplicate sessions are a strong risk for freelancing platforms and can affect your account and close it.
You need to keep your computer on 24 hours a day as you have to work in different time zones.
One account can be used per IP address, and we need to use the account on one IP.
Also, the account can only be used on one computer.


Since we are doing long-term cooperation, you should be aware of all the issues yourself and be able to inform your friends well.
''''''''''''''''''''

I have another good suggestion. 
I have a few colleagues, of course they are my colleagues.
Please introduce them to your friends.
My colleagues would also like to work with someone like you.
We will have a long-term partnership.
Age does not matter, but I will limit anyone younger than you.
I will share a portion of my income with you.


suggestions for more projects and higher profits


Hello

My name is WenMing Lee, and I’m a  full-stack developer based in Singapore.
I recently came across your profile on github and was really impressed with your experience and skills. 
Until now I have worked as a full-stack developer in several freelancing platforms, but with my Asian profile I couldn’t get good jobs because most clients don’t like Asian developers.
Recently, I have noticed some of my colleagues are collaborating with European people and they are getting good jobs using their European profile. So I have decided to find a reliable collaborator who can help me.
So my suggestion is that I would like to create a freelancing platforms account using your profile and use it in your laptop remotely.
So you just need to assist me when I create accounts and provide 24/7 access to the laptop in your location. (It will not take your time too much)
Regarding the compensation, I can pay 100$ per month flatly or 10% of my monthly income.
You can choose any option freely.
So in that case, if you have an extra laptop that you are not using right now.
If you have a computer, it would be good for each other's safety and convenience.
The reason that I need to use it remotely is that most freelancing platforms detect local IP addresses so I can’t use it in my location and any VPNs.
I want to collaborate with you to create mutual wealth.
Specifically, I think you know a lot about upwork.com.
In my previous message, I explained in detail the difficulties I am currently facing and also told you all my plans for the future.
Please let me know your thoughts on my suggestion. Hope we will discuss more details.

Best Regards

If one account is useful in IP address and does not interfere with each other's work, you should install VMware.

Hi, I'm a  full-stack developer from Singapore. I’m seeking a reliable collaborator to assist in creating and managing freelancing platform accounts using their profile and laptop remotely, as local IP restrictions prevent me from doing so. Compensation includes $100/month or 10% of my earnings. Let DM me if you're interested!

Hello

Actually I have another kind of offer for you, but I can't describe it directly in this Platform, so I have posted some jobs there.
My name is Wen Ming Lee, and I’m a senior full-stack developer based in Singapore.
As you know Asian developers' hourly rate is low and most US/European clients don't like Asian developers so I closed my account a few months ago.
But recently I have noticed some of my developer friends are collaborating with Europeanopean developers using their Upwork, they were sending proposals using Europeanopean  accounts and getting high hourly jobs and sharing incomes with their collaborators.
So I have decided to find a reliable collaborator who can assist me, so I have contacted you for the collaboration.
I guess you have used Upwork as a freelancer, so you know the most time taking process it takes to send proposals there, so I mean I can handle the proposal sending process and development part once we get a job.
I am also familiar with Upwork bidding strategy so I am sure we would get remote jobs easily soon.
Please let me know your thoughts on my suggestion. Hope we will discuss more details.

Hi,

Nice to meet you here! I have an offer I'd like to share with you, and I’d appreciate your response.
I am Steven form HongKong. I am currently looking for a reliable collaborator to assist me. My offer does not require any specific skills or extra effort on your side. I understand that trust is important, so I want to assure you that this is a genuine opportunity with fair compensation. If you decide to join, I would truly appreciate it and can provide monthly payments. The budget is flexible and can be discussed to ensure it works well for you.
I’m sorry, but I understand that outside communication is against Fiverr’s rules. However, as you may know, there are many scammers both clients and freelancers on this platform, and communication here can be quite slow and restrictive. I have experienced this myself.Because of these limitations, I can't share all the details here. If you're open to it, I’d be happy to discuss my offer further on Telegram or Discord. te1egram:valutine disc0rd:michaelpcobb530
Have you ever heard of the Upwork freelancing platform? My offer is directly related to your Upwork account.
In fact, I am interested in using your Upwork account. If you are actively using it, I’d like to know how much you earn on Upwork.
Actually, I have been working on Upwork for the past five years and have successfully completed projects with many US clients. However, due to irregular activity, my Upwork account has been disabled.
Additionally, as an Asian developer, I’ve noticed that hourly rates tend to be lower, and some US clients prefer to work with non-Asian freelancers. If I were to use your Upwork account, I am confident that I could earn over $4,000 per month.
I can create an account using some VPN or VPS to avoid IP/Location issues but their proxy will be detected by Upwork.
Because Upwork detect the IP address, it is safe for us to use the account using your pc that create it.
To keep your account on safe, I am going to work on your PC by remotely.
I get that I don’t have solid guarantees to prove it, but if you let me show my work for a few days, I’m sure you’ll see for yourself that I’m genuine. And a few day later, Upwork require ID verificatioin, then I will pay $10.
If you can provide me with an account and a small workspace on your PC, I will only use it to send proposals and communicate with my clients. Most of the development work will be done on my laptop. That’s all.
If you help me, I will provide you with 10% of my total monthly income or $100 fixed profit without any extra work required on your part.
If you agree, please let me know your preferred payment method and allow me to start placing bids right away.
As I mentioned before, to be precise, your account is new, and your profile is not well-suited to my skill. Since I need to make several adjustments during the first month, it will be challenging for me at first. Therefore, I will pay you 18% of my total income on the 25th of every month. If everything goes well, I will provide additional compensation.
I am sorry for late response.

If everything goes well, I will provide additional compensation.
Currently, since you haven’t placed any bids on Upwork, your account has not been verified yet. I can place bids using your Upwork account for 2-3 days, after which it will be verified. Once the process is complete, I will send you $15 immediately. If you agree, please let me know your preferred payment method and allow me to start placing bids right away.
No, if I don’t earn anything early on, I will provide $150, but that will never happen.
Unfortunately, your account has not been verified yet. Since I work full-time, if I place bids on Upwork, I am confident that your account will be verified within a few days. However, if you plan to place bids yourself, I must warn you that it can be very risky the first time.
As I mentioned before, once the verification is successful, I will send you the payment immediately.
I understand your concern. I believe the first payment is not an issue at this point. However, keeping your Upwork account safe is important, so I suggest letting me place bids on Upwork for you.
If you insist, I must tell you that I also have my own rules. Once your Upwork account is verified, we can discuss this again.
I believe it’s not appropriate to discuss the first payment before I start working and before your Upwork account is verified.
I’m sorry for not being able to fully trust you yet, but for our collaboration to be long-term, I believe this is absolutely necessary.




Proposal 1:
Subject: Business Collaboration Proposal

Hello,

I am WenMing Lee, a senior full-stack developer based in Singapore. 
I recently stumbled upon your profile on GitHub and am really impressed by your experience and skills.
I have been working as a full-stack developer on several freelance platforms, but I have had a hard time getting high-paying jobs due to my Asian profile. 
Unfortunately, it seems that many clients prefer to work with developers from Europe or North America.
I recently found out that some of my colleagues have been collaborating with developers in Europe and using their profiles to overcome this challenge. 
This strategy has helped them get better job opportunities.
I am reaching out to see if you are interested in a partnership. 
My idea is to create a freelance account using your profile and work remotely through your computer. 
Since most freelancing platforms detect local IP addresses and block VPN usage, this setup will allow you to bypass these restrictions.
In terms of compensation, I offer 10% of your monthly income. 
If you have a spare computer that you are not using, this can be an easy way to generate passive income and can help you secure better projects.
If you are open to discussing this further, please let me know and I will be happy to answer any questions or clarify details.
I'd like to discuss via telegram or something
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Proposal 2:
Subject: Seeking a reliable partner for win-win collaboration

Hello ,
Hope you are doing well. 
My name is WenMing Lee and I am a senior full-stack developer based in Singapore. 
I stumbled upon your GitHub profile and was impressed by your professional background and skill set.
I have been working as a freelancer for a while now but I have had trouble securing quality projects due to my Asian profile. 
I have seen that many clients on platforms like Upwork tend to prefer developers with European profiles.
That is why I am reaching out to you. 
I would like to propose a partnership where I can create a freelance account using your profile and work remotely through your computer. Freelance platforms detect local IP addresses and block VPNs, so accessing directly from a European location will greatly improve your chances.
I will offer 10% of your monthly earnings as a reward. 
If you have a spare computer, this could be an easy way for you to earn passive income and help me advance my career.
Let me know if you would like to know more. 
I will be happy to answer your questions or provide more details.
I'd like to discuss via telegram or something
I look forward to hearing from you.

Proposal 3:
Subject: Partnership Opportunity for Mutual Success

Hello ,

My name is WenMing Lee and I am a senior full stack developer from Singapore. 
I stumbled upon your profile on GitHub and was impressed by your experience and expertise.
I have been working as a freelancer for quite some time but have had a hard time securing well-paying projects due to my location and background. 
It seems that many clients prefer developers from Europe or North America.
Some of my colleagues have solved this problem by partnering with developers from Europe. 
This allows them to represent themselves with a European profile. 
I would like to have a similar partnership with you.
My proposal is to create a freelancing account using your profile and work remotely through your computer. 
Direct access is essential as freelancing platforms monitor IP addresses and VPNs do not work as a solution.
I offer 10% of my monthly income as compensation. 
If you have a spare computer, this could be a simple way to earn passive income while also supporting my career growth.
Let me know if you are interested in discussing this further. 
I would be happy to provide more information or clarify details.
I'd like to discuss via telegram or something
Thank you for considering my suggestion.
