I am a senior web & mobile developer with over 8 years of experience from Singapore.
I have worked with my account on the Upwork platform and got over 5000$ a month but my account was suspended several months ago due to irregular activities.
My one client wanted to work with me off the platform, so I agreed. 
That’s why my account was disabled.
So I would like to use your Upwork.com account.


___________________Why did you use your own account?___________________



In fact, I can create another Asian upwork account. 
But as you know, European and American clients prefer to work with European or South American developers, because they have professional skills and provide high quality work. 
So, working with your Upwork account makes it easier for me to get jobs on Upwork and makes a lot more money than using an Asian account. 
That’s why I would like to use your Upwork account.

If you don't work on Upwork right now, I believe you can help me. 


If you can help me, I can earn over 8000$ every month and I will share 10~15% of the total income from Upwork every month.
If you can help me call my clients ,  I will pay additional money.

I'm always place great emphasis on like next. 
Signing into your account from my PC will block your account. 
This is because Upwork always tracks the computer's Ip address. 
So, I need to access your account on VMware or a secondary computer through Anydesk or Teamviewer.
It’s better for you because you can check all my work.

I'm serious without trying to cheat you at all.
I think the most important thing in our collaboration is to trust each other.
Without this, we cannot work together.

If you agree with my suggestion, feel free to contact me.
Welcome at any time.
If my suggestion bothers you, accept my apology.
Thank you for reviewing my suggestion.
