Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly.

Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast

Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise

Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong

Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast

Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast

 when Im down and oh my soul so weary
 when troubles come and my heart burndened me
 when Im still and wait here in the silence
 until you come and sit an while with me
 you raise me up so I can stand on mountain
 you raise me up to walk on stormy sea
 Im strong when Im on your shoulders
 You rasie me up to more than I can be
