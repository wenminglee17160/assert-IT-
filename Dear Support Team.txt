Dear Support Team,

My name is Juan, and I’m a freelancer living in Colombia.
First, I want to take a moment to express my deep appreciation for the incredible effort your team puts into supporting hundreds of thousands of freelancers around the world. Your dedication and commitment do not go unnoticed, and I’m sincerely grateful for the work you do every day.
The reason I’m writing today is because I’m facing an issue that I haven’t been able to resolve on my own, despite trying everything I could.
About a month ago, I created my freelance account and immediately submitted the necessary documents to verify my identity. While the ID verification was approved without any issues, my proof of address kept getting rejected.
Following the support team’s instructions, I resubmitted various documents bank statements, utility bills, and even an official document issued by the city government that clearly shows my full name and address. Unfortunately, every attempt resulted in the same outcome: rejection.
I suspect the problem may be related to the length of my name (nicolas full name)and address(nicolass fulladdress), as both are quite long. Still, I made sure all the information was accurate and matched the requirements each time. Then, yesterday, after submitting my most recent document one officially approved by the city my account was suddenly logged out. When I tried to log back in, I was told that my email, username, and password were incorrect. I was shocked and confused.
I want to make it clear that I’ve never violated any platform policies. I’ve always followed the rules and reached out to the support team whenever I had questions or concerns. Now, I find myself helpless and uncertain of what to do next.
But in that moment of uncertainty, I remembered the support team the people who work so hard, patiently and sincerely helping freelancers like me day after day. That memory gave me a spark of hope and the courage to reach out to you now.
I recently began working and managed to earn some income something that felt like a huge personal victory and brought renewed hope and pride to my family.
This account means more to me than just a way to earn income. I carry the responsibility of supporting my grandparents my grandmother who struggles with her eyesight, and my grandfather as well as my younger sibling. I recently started earning through freelancing, and for the first time in a long time, I felt a sense of hope and stability for my family. But that joy was short lived, and I never imagined my account would be shut down like this.
Please, I am asking from the bottom of my heart: help me understand what happened to my account and what I can do to restore it. I just want the opportunity to continue building a future for my loved ones. I have no intention of giving up, and I believe in the fairness and compassion of this platform.
There’s a saying: What may seem trivial to one person can mean everything to another. 
To some, the struggles of an unknown freelancer might seem small—but to me and my family, this is our lifeline. This platform has given me a chance to work, to dream, and to believe in a better tomorrow.
I am truly sorry if my situation has caused any inconvenience. I only ask for your help in resolving this issue.

With deep respect and gratitude,
Juan
