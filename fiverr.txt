yeah, as you know the current account is new account so we don't have any work history in upwork account.
So we need to find some small jobs first that fits with our profile.
So I am currently sending proposals to fixed price project.
I think we can get bigger project after we grow our account a little bit.
It can take some time, as you know there are too many freelancers in Upwork, so it is a little bit hard to win in the competition.
