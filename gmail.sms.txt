Proposal to Collaborate Using Your Upwork Account for Mutual Benefit

Hi,
I am a senior web & mobile developer with over 5 y of experience from Singapore.
I have worked with my account on the Upwork platform and got over 4000$ a month.
In fact, I can create another Asian Upwork account.
But as you know, American and European  clients prefer to work with American or European developers, because they have professional skills and provide high quality work.
So, working with your Upwork account makes it easier for me to get jobs on Upwork and makes a lot more money than using an Asian account.
Thatâ€™s why I would like to use your Upwork account.
If you can help me, I'm going to share 10~15% of the income from Upwork.
If you are interested, please DM me.

Thanks

as a mentioned before I can create an account using some VPN or VPS to avoid IP/Location issues but their proxy will be detected by Upwork. 
After all, it will be banned by Upwork.


I guess you have used Up|work as a freelancer, so you know the most time taking process it takes to send proposals there, so I mean I can handle the proposal sending process and development part once we get a job.
