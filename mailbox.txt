Dear you,
I hope this message finds you well. My name is Steven, and I am a senior full-stack developer based in Hong Kong.
While working as a full-stack developer on various freelancing platforms, I have encountered challenges due to regional preferences from clients. Many of my colleagues have successfully collaborated with EU-based clients by registering their profiles within the EU, which has led me to explore similar opportunities.
I am seeking a reliable collaborator who can assist me with this. Specifically, I require access to an Upwork or Freelancer account and a small working space on your PC for sending proposals and communicating with clients. All development work will be handled exclusively on my laptop.
Your involvement would require minimal effort, primarily the initial creation of the account. In return, I am offering a percentage of my monthly income (10-20%). Alternatively, we can start with a fixed amount of $150 per month, which could increase to $300-$500 as our collaboration progresses. If everything goes smoothly, I am open to discussing a more flexible arrangement.
If you have an extra laptop that is not in use, that would be ideal. Even If you don't have extra laptop, it is alright. Otherwise, setting up a virtual machine as an alternative could work. By installing AnyDesk on the virtual machine, I would be able to access it remotely, ensuring that your main PC remains unaffected. Rest assured, I would have no access to your primary system or any personal data.
If you didn't register or use your Upwork account, my offer would be efficient use of it.
The reason for requesting remote access is that freelancing platforms detect local IP addresses, which prevents me from using them from my location or via VPNs.
I am looking for a long-term collaboration and a strong partnership. If this opportunity is not suitable for you, I would greatly appreciate it if you could introduce me to someone—such as a relative, friend, or colleague—who might be interested.
I understand this may be an unusual request, so I am happy to address any questions or concerns via Discord:
Discord: michaelpcobb530
I believe this collaboration could be mutually beneficial, and I look forward to your response.
Best regards,
Steven

After receiving your response, I am confident that we can work together, given that you are sharing the same struggles as I am.
I am deeply touched by your understanding and hope that you will take the time out of your busy schedule to read this message again.

I want to collaborate with you to create mutual wealth.
Specifically, I think you know a lot about upwork.com.

Hi,

Hope you are doing well!
I recently stumbled upon your GitHub profile and I am really impressed with your experience and skills. 
My name is Wen Ming Lee and I am a full stack developer living in Singapore. 
I have been working on several freelance platforms but lately I have been having trouble landing quality projects not because of my skills but because of the language barrier and my Asian profile.
I am fluent in English and very good at coding, but my accent and speaking skills have made it difficult for me to succeed in interviews. 
That is when I realized that partnering with experienced developers from Europe or the US can open up more opportunities for both of us.
Here is what I think:
I can handle actual development work quickly and efficiently. I am confident that I can manage at least two full-time jobs at a time.
If you have an ongoing project or are looking to secure more work on a platform like Upwork, I can help. 
I have experience with Upwork's bidding strategy and can handle proposal submissions on your behalf.
Once you have a project, I can handle the development work and communicate with the client if necessary.
I am flexible with compensation. 
You can pay a flat fee or share the project revenue.
If you are uncomfortable sharing your existing projects, another option is to create an Upwork account using your profile. 
As European profiles usually attract higher paying clients.
 You will only need access to a laptop in your location to avoid IP detection issues. 
 In return, I will be happy to pay you 10% of my earnings each month. 
I truly believe this collaboration can be a win-win for both of us. 
Your strong profile combined with my technical skills and work ethic can lead to a steady stream of highly profitable projects.
Let me know what you think. 
I would love to discuss this further. Thanks for considering my offer. 
I will get back to you soon!

Thank you,
Wen Ming Li

Your suggestions for more projects and higher profits

Hi

I hope all is going well on your end!
I recently came across your profile on github and was really impressed with your experience and skills. 
My name is Wen Ming Lee, and I’m a senior full-stack developer based in singapore.
Until now I have worked as a full-stack developer in several freelancing platforms, but for now it is really hard to get jobs as a freelancer so I have decided to collaborate with European senior developers because my job interview skills are poor.
Everytime I tried the interview, I failed because of my verbal English and Asian accent.
But I can perfectly understand English and I'm really good at coding.
Also I am a very fast worker, so I can handle at least 2 or more full-time jobs myself.
So I think you can forward(subcontract) your current jobs to me and then you can focus on getting more jobs and we will be able to get more remote jobs.
Regarding the compensation, you can give me a salary or we can share the profit from the jobs.
My main skills are React, Next.js, Vue, Python, Node, Laravel, LLM, Typescript and nearly everything related to Javascript and TypeScript.
You may have no project or you can’t forward your current work for some privacy reasons, then we can try to get new jobs from Upwork.
Actually in Upwork, the most boring and time taking process is to send proposals,
I can handle the proposal submissions, and if we land a job, I’ll take care of the development work and you’d just need to have a call with the client when necessary.
Normally we can get jobs for 40 - 50/hr with an European account and we can share the profit.
This way, we can get more jobs, and I can take care of all of the development work.
I am also familiar with Upwork bidding strategy so I am sure we would get remote jobs easily soon.
Please let me know your thoughts on my suggestion. Hope we will discuss more details.

Best regards.

Proposal for a Collaborative Approach to Freelance Development

Hello 

I hope this message is well received!
 My name is Wen Ming Lee and I am a senior full-stack developer based in Singapore.
I recently came across your profile on github and was really impressed with your experience and skills. 
I have been working as a freelancer for the past few years and have worked with various clients on platforms such as Upwork, Freelancer, etc. 
While I have been successful in delivering high-quality work, I have had significant difficulties in securing jobs due to my poor English and Asian accent, which has made interviews difficult. 
Despite this, I have developed a deep understanding of English and am confident in my ability to perform at a high technical level.
Based on my experience, I have decided to explore the possibility of working with talented developers in Europe, where the market is thriving and opportunities are abundant. My coding skills are top-notch, but I have had difficulty communicating effectively in interviews, which has limited my growth. 
I believe that working together can help overcome these challenges. 
I can focus on delivering outstanding technical results, and you can handle client communication and the interview process.
As a senior developer with deep expertise in React, Next.js, Vue, Python, Node.js, Laravel, Typescript, and many other technologies, I am confident in my ability to manage multiple projects simultaneously. 
In fact, I am fast and efficient enough to handle more than one full-time job, ensuring timely and excellent results. 
I am also very adept at developing responsive and scalable web applications, handling both front-end and back-end tasks, and implementing sophisticated features for my clients.
My offer is simple. 
We can collaborate in a way that allows you to subcontract your current or future projects to me. 
You can focus on getting more clients, and I can handle the development work. 
I fully understand that you may not be able to share your current work due to privacy or confidentiality concerns, and we can focus on finding new projects together. 
I can start by targeting platforms like Upwork, where I am familiar with the bidding process and strategies for securing projects quickly.
One of the most time-consuming parts of working as a freelancer on Upwork is submitting proposals. 
I can handle all the proposal submissions and coordinate them to attract the best clients, while you focus on client communication and project scope setting.
 Once the job is done, I can handle the development, and you can have the occasional phone call or meeting with the client when needed.
As we both know, working with European-based accounts on platforms like Upwork can get you a competitive rate of $40-$50 per hour or more, depending on the scope of the project. We can agree on a revenue share model, where you get a percentage of your client care and I get a fair share of my development role.
I am confident that this collaboration will bring us mutual success, grow our client base, and streamline our work, expanding opportunities for both of us. 
I would like to hear your thoughts on this proposal and discuss how we can move forward. 
If you are interested, we can schedule a telegram or email to discuss in more detail.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thank you.

As you know Asian developers hourly rate is low and most of US clients don't like Asian developers so I have closed my account a few months ago.
But recently I have noticed some of my developer friends are collaborating US developers using their Upwork, they were sending proposals using US account and getting high hourly jobs and sharing incomes with their collaborators.
So I have decided to find reliable collaborator who can assist me, so I have contacted to you for the collaboration.
But actually I don't know your current situation, so let me know your opinion about this kind of collaboration.
I guess you have used Upwork as a freelancer, so you know the most time taking process it to send proposals there, so I mean I can handle the proposal sending process and development part as well.
You just need to handle the meeting with the clients,
Let me know your thought about my suggestion.

Dear you,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Steven, and I am a senior full-stack developer based in Hong Kong. As I continue to expand my freelancing career, I am exploring opportunities to enhance my ability to connect with clients in the EU market.

To achieve this, I am looking for a professional collaborator who can provide assistance by granting access to an Upwork or Freelancer account and a designated workspace on their PC for proposal submissions and client interactions. Please rest assured that all technical work will be conducted solely on my own laptop.

Your involvement in this partnership would be minimal, primarily limited to the initial account setup. In return, I am offering either a share of my monthly earnings (10-20%) or a fixed monthly payment starting at $150, which could increase to $300-$500 as our collaboration develops. If you have an extra laptop, that would be optimal; otherwise, we can consider setting up a virtual machine with AnyDesk for secure remote access. This setup ensures that your main system remains untouched and private.

I understand that this is a unique request, and I welcome any questions or concerns you may have. If this is not something you are interested in, I would greatly appreciate any referrals to someone in your network who might be open to this opportunity.

Should you wish to discuss this further, I am available on Discord at michaelpcobb530. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Steven

Collaboration Proposal

Hello,

I am Wen Ming Lee, a senior full-stack developer with expertise in React, Next.js, Vue, Python, Node.js, Laravel, and TypeScript. I am good at development, but I had a hard time in interviews because of my English accent.
I propose a collaboration where I handle all the development work, and you focus on client communication and project security. You can start on a platform like Upwork and split the revenue fairly, and earn 10% using your account.
If you are interested, let's discuss how we can work together effectively.

Thank you,
Wen Ming Lee


\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Boss

I'm Cui, a frontend developer with over 8 years of experience in React, Vue, and Angular. For many years, I've been working on Upwork through a Germany-based account, where I've built a solid reputation with clients. Unfortunately, the person who let me use his account can no longer support me due to personal reasons. So now, I'm looking for someone to collaborate with, and your GitHub profile caught my attention.

In the past, I've worked successfully with the Germany account owner by paying them 10% of my monthly earnings . I'd like to set up a similar long-term partnership with you.

Here's how it could work:

Option 1: Use Your Existing Upwork Account
If you have an Upwork account that you don't use much, I'd love to use it when you're not active. To avoid any issues, I'd access it directly from your computer using remote tools like TeamViewer or AnyDesk. This ensures the account stays secure and avoids IP conflicts.

Option 2: Create a New Account Together
If you're open to it, you could create a new Upwork account specifically for this collaboration.

- How can we transfer money with each other?
You can add Payoneer or Paypal to your Upwork account and If I earn some money using your Upwork account, we can withdraw it via your Payoneer or Paypal.
And then you can get 10 % of the money from there and you can send the rest of the money to my Paypal or Payoneer.

- Why do I need access to your locale via Teamviewer or Anydesk?
Upwork has strict rules about accounts being used from different locations. If I try to access the account through a VPN, VPS, or AWS server, it will likely get blocked because Upwork detects proxy server IPs. That's why I need to use your account directly from your local computer. If you're worried about privacy, we can set up a virtual machine (VM) on your computer to keep everything separate.

- You don't have to worry about me stealing and have your Upwork account. Why?
You don't need to worry about me misusing your account. If I tried to log in from another location, Upwork would immediately block it due to IP changes. Plus, Upwork sometimes requires video chats with clients, so your involvement is essential.

Additional Opportunities
If you have any personal projects that need development work, I'd be happy to help bring them to life. My experience ensures high-quality results tailored to your needs.

Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. I'd love to explore how we can make this partnership work for both of us. Thanks for considering, and I look forward to hearing from you!

Thanks
Cui
