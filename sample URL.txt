Hi,

I came across your project and it sounds like a great fit — I’d really enjoy helping you turn your Figma design into a clean, responsive landing page.

While I’m just getting started on Upwork, I have hands-on experience building pages like this using HTML, CSS, and React. I’ll make sure your page looks great on all screen sizes, loads quickly, and that the contact form works exactly how you need it to.

If you'd like, I can even put together a small section of the page as a free sample — that way you can get a feel for how I work before we move forward.

I’m easy to communicate with, reliable, and I take pride in delivering high-quality work. Let me know if you’d like to chat more about the project — I’d be happy to get started right away!

Best,
Ronald
