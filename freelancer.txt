 I’ve submitted my proof of address, but it was declined. I live with my Grandfather in Colombia, so I don’t have utility bills or a lease in my name.

I can provide a bank statement with my current address or a signed declaration with supporting documents.

Please let me know which options are acceptable for my case.

Thank you for  sending this please wait for me to check on your account.

23:37
Thanks for waiting. In your situation, a bank statement with your current address is typically an acceptable proof of address. However, submitting a utility bill that is not under your name can be rejected.

23:40
As you need to provide a proof of address that is under your name.

23:40
If you have the bank statement under your name that would suffice.

23:40
Will it pass this time?


23:42
Are the bank statement I uploaded sufficient?


23:44
Looks like the team has deemed the last address invalid.

23:45
As such please do submit a new documents that is listed here: 

Bank Statement (issued within the last three months)
Utility Bills (issued within the last three months)
Income Tax Return (issued within the last year)
Residence ID/Permit
Notarized Leasing Agreement/Contract (issued within the last year)
Passbook (issued within the last year only)
Any valid government-issued ID as long as it has your name, current address, photo, date of birth, signature and the ID's issue date. 

23:46
Remember the following:

The document must have your full name and address that is not in/containing P.O Box.
The document must clearly display the issuing authority's name, address, and phone number. 
Digital/online copy of documents are accepted (e.g. bank statements, utility bills). Make sure to send the PDF copy, and not a screenshot of it.
If the document is an e-bill or e-bank statement, it should not be password-protected.
